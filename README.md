Colt Steele's Ping Pong Project from his Udemy bootcamp

His bootcamp offers a code along, but this is what I came up with after seeing the example. 

Not identical just yet, but it matches the main design and all the buttons work. 


I now need to do the following: 

1. Insert selector that allows user determine the winning score

2. Change color of winning score to green and losing score to red

3. No longer allow scores to be added after winner is announced
